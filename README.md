# try-MERN
preface:
my first app using MongoDB(Mongoose), Node.Js, Express.
I will also use this opportunity to work with Typescript.
This is going to be an SPA using React, Redux.

Recap
After some thinking I decide to use CRA with Typescript for the frontend, and Express generator to generate the backend and make sure the types are configured manually.
